          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>
            spoonacular will be the first food management system that combines
            dining out, eating store-bought food, and cooking at home to help
            you find and organize the restaurants, products, and recipes that
            fit your diet and can help you reach your nutrition goals.
          </p>

            As a spoonacular user, you can already add your favorite recipes and
            store bought products to our <span className="fw-bold">free meal planner</span>, which automatically
            generates your shopping list and calculates the nutritional
            information for you. Whether you're cooking from scratch or picking
            something up at the store, our meal planner doubles as a <span className="fw-bold">food
            tracker</span>  that counts your calories, protein, fat, carbs, sugar, and
            other nutrients for you. With our <span className="fw-bold">food search engine</span> , you will soon
            find everything from "protein shake with 20 grams of protein" to
            "best vegan restaurant in Chicago" to "Paleo brownie recipes." We
            want to make spoonacular the only site you need when it comes to the
            food you eat. <span className="fw-bold">All your food. One place.</span>
